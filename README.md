## Overview
Our feline friends provide **120+ snarky code reviews** to help you improve your programming skills with a touch of humor (and judgment).

After hearing about the [GitHub Archive Program](https://archiveprogram.github.com/) that preserves open-source software for future generations, I decided to contribute this little app. The world definitely needs more snarky cats.

## Features
- **Random snarky comments** from cats who’ve seen worse.
- **Cat images** fetched from [The Cat API](https://thecatapi.com/).
- **Simple, brutal honesty** to keep you on your toes.
